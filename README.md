#### Course Description

Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of
predictors of interest using linear assumptions. Regression models, a
subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis
tool in a data scientist’s toolkit. This course covers regression
analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special
cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well.
Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course
will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of
regression models including scatterplot smoothing.
