#### Course Description

> Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of
> predictors of interest using linear assumptions. Regression models, a
> subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis
> tool in a data scientist’s toolkit. This course covers regression
> analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special
> cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as
> well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The
> course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of
> regression models including scatterplot smoothing.
